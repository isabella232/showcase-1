    The <a href="https://factory.c4dt.org/incubator/stainless/demo/">Stainless Demonstrator</a>
    shows how Stainless helps develop Smart
    Contracts free of errors. It provides an interactve environment
    where the user can verify prewritten Smart Contracts, deploy them on
    a blockchain, and call their functions.

<p>
    A first introductory scenario involves a Candy Shop that maintains
    its candy balance with a simple Smart Contract, which prevents people
    from cheating by taking away more candies than are available. A second
    scenario illustrates a bug in a Smart Contract that appeared on the
    Ethereum blockchain a few years ago, and led to a controversial fork
    to prevent significant monetary loss. It also explains how Stainless
    could have prevented it.

<p>The following screenshot shows the start of the demonstrator. The tutorial
    (2) will guide you through the various elements of the interface and help you
    on your way.</p>

    Please note that this demonstrator is fairly technical, and requires
    the user to have a background in software development and blockchain
    technology to fully benefit from it.
