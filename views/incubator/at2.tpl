<h2>Introduction to Blockchains</h2>

<p>
  Blockchains have been around for some years now, you've probably come across the
  term multiple times. But what is a blockchain? Put simply, it's a way to send
  some virtual money without using banks or intermediaries. There is no central
  authority keeping tabs on who owns what, rather, each participant validates
  every monetary transaction. One of the most known and used is Bitcoin, which
  uses what is called a proof-of-work to achieve that, a very energy intensive
  process. It can handle around 7 transactions per second (TPS), which is not
  great compared to payment systems like Visa which handles 40'000 TPS.

<h2>How AT2 is used in this Demo</h2>

<p>
  In this specific case of asset transfer, one doesn't need a "full-blockchain",
  only some simpler primitives. Here comes AT2, which allows for the same
  capabilities as Bitcoin while being orders of magnitudes faster, around 10'000
  TPS. By avoiding the classical proof-of-work used in other blockchains, it
  also greatly reduces the total energy consumption.

  In the demonstrator, you will be able to create your own account on the AT2
  chain, that we graciously fill up with an initial number of assets. You can
  then send assets to some other previously registered user. You will also be
  performing a speedtest to measure how many transactions the system can hold.
  The main AT2 network is currently run at EPFL by some labs and interested
  users.
