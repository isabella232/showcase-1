    description: Highly detailed heap profiler
    layman_desc: >
      Modern software systems heavily use the memory heap. As systems grow more
      complex and compute with increasing amounts of data, it can be difficult
      for developers to understand how their programs actually use the bytes
      that they allocate on the heap and whether improvements are possible.
      Memoro as built to answer this question of heap usage efficiency. It uses
      a combination of static instrumentation, subroutine interception, and
      runtime data collection to build a clear picture of exactly when and
      where a program performs heap allocation, and crucially how it actually
      uses that memory. Memoro also introduces a new visualization application
      that can distill collected data into scores and visual cues that allow
      developers to quickly pinpoint and eliminate inefficient heap usage in
      their software.

    description: Precise side-channel analysis
    layman_desc: >
      Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive information
      from non-functional characteristics. Typical side-channel detection tools
      are able to identify many potential vulnerabilities, but do not provide
      information regarding their severity, making it difficult for developers
      to decide whether to address them, as their leaks are often negligible in
      practice. Abacus is able to precisely quantify the leaked information and
      finds flaws that would otherwise be difficult for a developer to find.
