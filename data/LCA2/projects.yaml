      This project defines a message format, based on Cap'n Proto, for
      encoding certain mathematical objects (i.e., real-valued symbolic
      expressions, sets and set-valued functions) as sequences of bytes.

    description: Testbed for multi-agent real-time control of electric grids
    tech_desc: >
      T-RECS is a software testbed for multi-agent real-time control of electric grids. T-RECS uses
      software containers to run each agent in a virtual environment. Agents are networked via Mininet,
      so real packets are exchanged using TCP/IP.
