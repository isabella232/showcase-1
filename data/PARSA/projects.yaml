    layman_desc: >
      CloudSuite is a benchmark suite for cloud services. The third release
      consists of eight applications that have been selected based on their
      popularity in today's datacenters. The benchmarks are based on
      real-world software stacks and represent real-world setups.

      Co-located DNN Training and Inference

      HBFP is a hybrid Block Floating-Point (BFP) - Floating-Point (FP) number representation for
      DNN training introduced by ColTraIn: Co-located DNN Training and Inference team of PARSA and
      MLO at EPFL. HBFP offers the best of both worlds: the high accuracy of floating-point at the
      superior hardware density of fixed-point by performing all dot products in BFP and other
      operations in FP32. For a wide variety of models, HBFP matches floating-point’s accuracy
      while enabling hardware implementations that deliver up to 8.5x higher throughput. This
      repository is for ongoing research on training DNNs with HBFP.
