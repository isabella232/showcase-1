    layman_desc: >
      Stainless is a tool for verifying Scala programs developed by the
      LARA. It can verify that your program is correct for all inputs, it
      can report inputs for which your program fails when they exist, and
      it can prove that functions do not loop. As an example application,
      Stainless can perform verification of Smart Contracts.

      title: Stainless-OmniLedger demonstrator
      description: >
        <p>
        This demonstrator shows how Stainless helps develop Smart
        Contracts free of errors.  It provides an interactve environment
        where the user can verify prewritten Smart Contracts, deploy them on
        a blockchain, and call their functions.
        </p>
        <p>
        A first introductory scenario involves a Candy Shop that maintains
        its candy balance with a simple Smart Contract, which prevents people
        from cheating by taking away more candies than are available.  A second
        scenario illustrates a bug in a Smart Contract that appeared on the
        Ethereum blockchain a few years ago, and led to a controversial fork
        to prevent significant monetary loss. It also explains how Stainless
        could have prevented it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Please note that this demonstrator is fairly technical, and requires
        the user to have a background in software development and blockchain
        technology to fully benefit from it.

      Inox can be used to prove constraints on methods in a program, to
      attest the correctness of these parts.
