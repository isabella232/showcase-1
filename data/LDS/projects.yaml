    description: A lattice-based multiparty homomorphic encryption library in Go
    tech_desc: >
      Lattigo is a Go module for Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption, that implements
      Ring-Learning-With-Errors-based homomorphic encryption primitives. It comprises
      highly-efficient RNS versions of the BFV and CKKS schemes and their multiparty
      (N-out-of-N-threshold) counterparts. It also implements a dense-key and
      sparse-key Bootstrapping procedure for RNS-CKKS.

      Lattigo 2.0.0 has been code-reviewed by ELCA in November 2020 and, within the allocated time for the code
      review, no critical or high-risk issues were found.
    layman_desc: >
      Homomorphic encryption (HE) comprises a special class of cryptographic
      schemes that enable computing directly on encrypted data, without requiring
      the data to be decrypted first. It therefore enables a set of operations
      (polynomial evaluation and approximations of non-polynomial functions) to
      be "blindly" performed on encrypted sensitive data by an untrustworthy party,
      with a controlled computational overhead. Lattigo implements HE and its
      multiparty extension (MHE), that enables several entities to collaboratively
      compute a function on their confidential or sensitive data, without revealing
      to each other anything besides the result of this computation. Lattigo's
      multiparty homomorphic encryption technology is an enabler for secure data
      sharing in multiple scenarios.

    layman_desc: >
      Drynx allows to create privacy-preserving queries on encrypted
      datasets that are stored at different data providers who don't
      want to share the original data.
      Different types of statistical queries are possible, like average,
      standard deviation, linear and logistic regressions - all using
      homomorphic encryption, which means that the data is never shared
      in cleartext.
