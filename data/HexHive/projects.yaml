      Our evaluation shows that on the Google fuzzer test suite, FuZZan improves fuzzing throughput over ASan by 48%
      starting with Google’s provided seeds (52% when starting with empty seeds on the same applications). Due to this
      improved throughput, FuZZan discovers 13% more unique paths given the same 24 hours and finds bugs 42% faster

    description: A Ground-Truth Fuzzing Benchmark
    tech_desc: >
      Magma is a collection of open-source libraries with widespread usage and a long history of security-critical
      bugs and vulnerabilities. In light of the need for better fuzzer evaluation, we front-ported bugs from
      previous bug reports to the latest versions of these libraries.

      For each ported bug, we added in-line (source-code-level) instrumentation to collect ground-truth
      information about bugs reached (buggy code executed) and triggered (fault condition satisfied by input).
      This instrumentation allows a monitoring utility to measure fuzzer progress in real time.

  shadowstack:

    description: LLVM Implementation of different ShadowStack schemes for x86_64
    layman_desc: >
      In computer security, a shadow stack is a mechanism for protecting
      a procedure's stored return address, such as from a stack buffer
      overflow. The shadow stack itself is a second, separate stack that
      \"shadows\" the program call stack. In the function prologue, a
      function stores its return address to both the call stack and the
      shadow stack. In the function epilogue, a function loads the return
      address from both the call stack and the shadow stack, and then
      compares them. If the two records of the return address differ,
      then an attack is detected; the typical course of action is simply
      to terminate the program or alert system administrators about a
      possible intrusion attempt.

    description: Host-based, Performance-counter-based Attack Detection System
    layman_desc: >
      Attacks change the execution behavior of a system. Our attack
      detection system HexPADS detects attacks through divergences from
      normal behavior using attack signatures. HexPADS collects
      information from the operating system on runtime performance
      metrics with measurements from hardware performance counters for
      individual processes. Cache behavior is a strong indicator of
      ongoing attacks like rowhammer, side channels, covert channels, or
      CAIN attacks. Collecting performance metrics across all running
      processes allows the correlation and detection of these attacks. In
      addition, HexPADS can mitigate the attacks or significantly reduce
      their effectiveness with negligible overhead to benign processes.

      After analyzing the various possibilities to replace GAEN, and
      examining the current related projects, we focused our work on
      collaborating with microG, a Free Software project dedicated to
      replacing all of GMS. This effort resulted in a way to use microG's
      contact tracing subset as a library, so that it can be bundled with
      an existing app without source code modification, and without other
      dependencies.
      </p>

      We produced a version of SwissCovid that uses this approach to run on any
