    description: A Ground-Truth Fuzzing Benchmark
    tech_desc: >
      Magma is a collection of open-source libraries with widespread usage and a long history of security-critical
      bugs and vulnerabilities. In light of the need for better fuzzer evaluation, we front-ported bugs from
      previous bug reports to the latest versions of these libraries.

      For each ported bug, we added in-line (source-code-level) instrumentation to collect ground-truth
      information about bugs reached (buggy code executed) and triggered (fault condition satisfied by input).
      This instrumentation allows a monitoring utility to measure fuzzer progress in real time.

  t-fuzz:
    name: T-Fuzz
    description: Fuzzing and crash analyzer
    layman_desc: >
      T-Fuzz (transformational fuzzing) improves fuzzing by detecting
      whenever the fuzzer is stuck and then modifying the underlying
      program to reach new program locations. This allows fuzzing to
      discover and test hard to reach code.

      RetroWrite can analyze the security of closed source binaries by applying
      an efficient fuzzying technique that usually only works when the source
      code is available. This makes it possible to trigger more errors than the
      default binary fuzzers available, while being much faster in finding these
      errors.

  shadowstack:
    name: ShadowStack
    description: LLVM Implementation of different ShadowStack schemes for x86_64
    layman_desc: >
      In computer security, a shadow stack is a mechanism for protecting
      a procedure's stored return address, such as from a stack buffer
      overflow. The shadow stack itself is a second, separate stack that
      "shadows" the program call stack. In the function prologue, a
      function stores its return address to both the call stack and the
      shadow stack. In the function epilogue, a function loads the return
      address from both the call stack and the shadow stack, and then
      compares them. If the two records of the return address differ,
      then an attack is detected; the typical course of action is simply
      to terminate the program or alert system administrators about a
      possible intrusion attempt.

  hexpads:
    name: HexPADS
    description: Host-based, Performance-counter-based Attack Detection System
    layman_desc: >
      Attacks change the execution behavior of a system. Our attack
      detection system HexPADS detects attacks through divergences from
      normal behavior using attack signatures. HexPADS collects
      information from the operating system on runtime performance
      metrics with measurements from hardware performance counters for
      individual processes. Cache behavior is a strong indicator of
      ongoing attacks like rowhammer, side channels, covert channels, or
      CAIN attacks. Collecting performance metrics across all running
      processes allows the correlation and detection of these attacks. In
      addition, HexPADS can mitigate the attacks or significantly reduce
      their effectiveness with negligible overhead to benign processes.

  freegaen:
    name: Free GAEN alternative
    description: Alternative to GAEN for contact tracing applications
    layman_desc: >
      Apple and Google developed the Google-Apple Exposure Notification
      system in order to provide a uniform API for contact-tracing apps
      while preserving user privacy. On Android, GAEN is integrated in
      the Google Play services, which is proprietary. As a consequence,
      users wanting to keep a free system, as well as phone manufacturers
      such as Huawei who don't have Google Play services cannot use these
      applications.
      This project aims to offer an alternative framework, based on
      open-source code, which requires only minimal changes to the apps.

      After analyzing the various possibilities to replace GAEN, and
      examining the current related projects, we focused our work on
      collaborating with microG, a Free Software project dedicated to
      replacing all of GMS. This effort resulted in a way to use microG's
      contact tracing subset as a library, so that it can be bundled with
      an existing app without source code modification, and without other
      dependencies.
      We produced a version of SwissCovid that uses this approach to run
      on any phone that does not have access to Google Play services.
