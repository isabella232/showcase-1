# Tags HOWTO

This is a list of used tags in the projects.
For a tag to be used, it must fulfill all following points:
- pillars - reflects category/ies and is used to order
- application verticals
- technical aspects

The tag-list here is sorted alphabetically, with all tags from one letter comma-separated.
At the end there is a list of projects and tags they'd like to use.
Once a second project would like to use one of these tags it's easy to add them.
If a new tag is added, also add it to `data.py`
