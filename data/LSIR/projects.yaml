    description: Platform for detecting specific risks and threats children are facing online
    url: https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsir/ai-research-aiding-online-children-safety
    layman_desc: >
      Machine Learning classifiers and tools to help
      with the detection of specific risks and threats children are
      facing while using their newly acquired phones.
      The classifiers perform on par or better than what exists on the
      market, and have been adapted to run smoothly on a mobile phone.
      The analysis can therefore run on the mobile phone without having
      to send any content to any server.
