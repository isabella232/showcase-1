    description: Privacy assistant for installing third party cloud apps
    layman_desc: >
      When installing third party apps for cloud services such as Google Drive
      or DropBox, PrivySeal compares the required permissions to the ones
      actually needed, and informs users about the data-driven insights that
      these apps can make about them (e.g. topics of interest, activity
      patterns, etc.). The goal is to make users aware of these facts and
      discourage them to install over-privileged apps.

    layman_desc: >
      Machine Learning classifiers and tools to help
      with the detection of specific risks and threats children are
      facing while using their newly acquired phones.
      The classifiers perform on par or better than what exists on the
      market, and have been adapted to run smoothly on a mobile phone.
      The analysis can therefore run on the mobile phone without having
      to send any content to any server.
