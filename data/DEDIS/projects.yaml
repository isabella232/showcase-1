    name: Proof-of-Personhood
    category: Privacy
    description: Proof that you are an actual person while keeping your anonymity
    layman_desc: >
      The internet allows for anonymous participation. While this is great for protecting people like
      whistleblowers, it can be a burden if people abuse it and create many fake accounts. This project
      implements a way to prove that you are a unique individual, while still guaranteeing you anonymity
      while you use services on the internet. Applications range from chat to e-voting and energy-efficient
      blockchains.
    tech_desc: >
      Fake accounts are a big problem on the internet, while not all people want or can identify
      themselves using state-issued identities. Proof-of-personhood proposes to use personhood parties
      where people have to physically show up and get identified as real persons. Using cryptographic
      primitives, it is then possible to prove that you were part of that group, without revealing your
      individual identity.

    description: Solving the consensus problem in a new way by creating a global clock
    tech_desc: >
      An attempt to simplify asynchronous consensus by building atop a novel
      threshold logical clock abstraction, which enables upper layers to
      operate as if on a synchronous network. This approach yields an
      asynchronous consensus protocol for fail-stop nodes that may be simpler
      and more robust than Paxos and its leader-based variants, requiring no
      common coins and achieving consensus in a constant expected number of
      rounds.
