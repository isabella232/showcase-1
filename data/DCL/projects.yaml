      Garfield is a library to build Byzantine machine learning
      (ML) applications on top of popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
      We show how to use Garfield to build different architectures for ML applications like single server,
      multiple workers (SSMW), multiple servers, multiple
      workers (MSMW), and fully decentralized architecture.
    layman_desc: >
      Training ML is done in a distributed fashion these days due to the usage of big models and huge datasets
      (for scalability reasons). This distribution inevitably leads to a higher probability of failure somewhere
      in the network. Garfield is a library/tool to ensure the correctness/convergence of training despite the
      presence of these failures. Garfield can be used to do so with various ML applications and architectures.

      AT2 is a full-fledged asset transfer system (cryptocurrency) without the
      need for a global consensus, allowing for faster transactions and better
      scalability than Bitcoin and consensus-based solutions.
    tech_desc: >
      We replace consensus with a lightweight building block -- a
      broadcast-based primitive -- to obtain a full-fledged asset transfer
      system (cryptocurrency). This system is more efficient and more
      scalable compared with Bitcoin and consensus-based solutions. AT2 is
      the first system to bypass consensus algorithms for implementing
      asset transfers.

      The FeGAN system enables training GANs in the Federated Learning setup.
      GANs are generative adversarial networks, a class of machine learning
      where two neural networks contest with each other.
      FeGAN is implemented on PyTorch and is using less bandwidth and is
      faster than using stat-of-the-art GANs implementations.

    description: Automatically chose the best locking algorithm
    layman_desc: >
      LOCKIN is a lock library that includes several lock algorithm
      implementations mainly in header files for ease of use. Essentially, you
      can use LOCKIN to easily modify the pthread mutex locks in a system with
      practically zero effort.
      GLS is a middleware that makes lock-based programming simple and
      effective. GLS offers the classic lock-unlock interface of locks.
      However, in contrast to classic lock libraries, GLS does not require
      any effort from the programmer for allocating and initializing locks,
      nor for selecting the appropriate locking strategy.

      Over 40 implementations of linked lists, hash tables, skip lists,
      binary search trees (BSTs), queues, priority queues, and stacks.
      ASCYLIB contains sequential, lock-based, and lock-free
      implementations for each data structure.
