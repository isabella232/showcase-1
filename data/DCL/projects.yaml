            Garfield is a library to build Byzantine machine learning
            (ML) applications on top of popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
            We show how to use Garfield to build different architectures for ML applications like single server,
            multiple workers (SSMW), multiple servers, multiple
            workers (MSMW), and fully decentralized architecture.
        layman_desc: >
            Training ML is done in a distributed fashion these days due to the usage of big models and huge datasets
            (for scalability reasons). This distribution inevitably leads to a higher probability of failure somewhere
            in the network. Garfield is a library/tool to ensure the correctness/convergence of training despite the
            presence of these failures. Garfield can be used to do so with various ML applications and architectures.

        description:  Asset Transfer System using lightweight broadcast-based primitives instead of consensus
        tech_desc: >
            We replace consensus with a lightweight building block -- a
            broadcast-based primitive -- to obtain a full-fledged asset transfer
            system (cryptocurrency). This system is more efficient and more
            scalable compared with Bitcoin and consensus-based solutions. AT2 is
            the first system to bypass consensus algorithms for implementing
            asset transfers.

          GLS is a middleware that makes lock-based programming simple and
          effective. GLS offers the classic lock-unlock interface of locks.
          However, in contrast to classic lock libraries, GLS does not require
          any effort from the programmer for allocating and initializing locks,
          nor for selecting the appropriate locking strategy.
