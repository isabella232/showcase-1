      he DEDIS team is working on projects related to large-scale collective
      authorities (cothorities), which distribute trust among a number of
      independent parties to allow scalable self-organizing communities.
      With no single trusted party, cothorities can secure software updates,
      provide public randomness, enable privacy-conscious medical-data sharing
      and a lot more.
      Other projects include communicating securely over insecure channels and
      fast, scalable, accountable anonymous communication.

      ur research focuses on software and systems security. Despite efforts
      and improvements in bug discovery techniques, some exploitable
      vulnerabilities will remain. We target techniques that both enable
      developers to discover and remove bugs and make programs resilient
      against the exploitation of unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities.
      <ul>
        <li>
          To discover bugs we propose (i) sanitization techniques that enforce
          a security property such as memory or type safety; given concrete
          program input, our sanitizers then flag any property violations
      </li>
      <li>
        (ii) fuzzing techniques that leverage static and dynamic analysis to
        create program inputs to explore program areas that are not yet covered
        through existing test cases. To protect against exploitable
        vulnerabilities, we focus on control-flow integrity using specific
        language semantics, enforcing type integrity, and protecting selective
        data. Under this premise, we focus on compiler-based, runtime-based, and
        language-based protection mechanisms and security policies that increase
        the resilience of applications against attacks (in the presence of
        software vulnerabilities). All prototypes are released as open-source.

      Research in the Distributed Information Systems Laboratory focuses on
      producing reliable information from the vast amount of data that is
      available on the Internet – a key challenge in today’s information society.
      <br>They are developing methods and systems that turn unstructured,
      heterogeneous and untrusted data into meaningful, reliable and
      understandeable information.
      <br>This is done in the context of concrete information processing tasks,
      such as data and knowledge integration, information retrieval, filtering
      and extraction, document understanding and trust and crediblity assessment.
      <br>Given that tackling these problem relies usually on the needs of the
      user and requires at the same time processing of large amounts of data,
      they explore methods that enable integration of human knowledge with
      state-of-the-art machine learning.
      <br>They apply the results of their work in concrete application domains,
      such as Media, Humanitarian Action and Knowledge Management in enterprises.

      The Parallel System Architecture Lab senses that information technology
      has undergone a major paradigm shift with sensors, embedded and mobile
      devices generating massive amounts of data to be augmented with backend
      cloud services for enhanced experience. Data has emerged as a currency for
      modern society. Datacenters are now the backbone of IT offering
      large-scale cloud services at low costs benefiting from and exploiting the
      economies of scale. With silicon efficiency scaling having dwindled since
      2004 and silicon density scaling slowing down, future digital platforms
      will rely on heterogeneous logic and memory to allow for IT scalability.
      Meanwhile, the demand for large-scale cloud services has grown dramatically
      faster than conventional silicon scaling making IT platform scalability a
      grand challenge. Future platforms will need hand-in-hand collaboration of
      application domain experts and platform designers to improve scalability.
      With many online services being in-memory and the minimum communication
      latency between the farthest nodes in a 20MW datacenter being microseconds,
      future server platforms will go through revolutionary changes in architecture
      to enable seamless aggregation of logic and memory resources across nodes, breaking
      the conventional system abstraction layers.

      The Lab of Digital Epidemiology is concerned with the dynamics of health
      and disease in human populations.
      <br>Research in epidemiology aims to identify the distribution, incidence,
      and etiology of human diseases to improve the understanding of the causes
      of diseases and to prevent their spread. Traditionally, epidemiology has
      been based on data collected by public health agencies through health
      personnel in hospitals, doctors’ offices, and out in the field. In recent
      years, however, novel data sources have emerged where data are frequently
      collected directly from individuals through the digital traces they leave
      as a consequence of modern communication and an increased use of electronic
      devices.
