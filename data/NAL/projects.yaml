            Performance Contracts for Software Network Functions
        tech_desc: >
             The goal of our work is to provide network operators and NF developers with comprehensive understanding of
             the NF’s entire performance profile, before it is deployed. Such understanding would, for instance, allow
             operators to conduct precise capacity planning and developers to make informed development decisions.

        description: Formally verified and performant software Middleboxes
        tech_desc: >
            Software stack and toolchain for building and running software
            middleboxes that are guaranteed to be correct, while providing
            competitive performance and preserving developer productivity. With
            Vigor, developers write the middlebox code (i.e., the software
            network function, or NF) in C atop a standard packet-processing
            framework, putting persistent state in data structures from a
            Vigor-provided library. Vigor then automatically verifies that the
            resulting software stack correctly implements a specification
            (written in Python).

        layman_desc: >
            LINE is a network emulator designed for realism, accuracy and
            powerful measurement capabilities. It is capable of emulating
            networks in real-time, forwarding actual network traffic generated by
            real Linux network stacks.
